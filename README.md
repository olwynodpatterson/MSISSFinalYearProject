**Final Year Project: Evaluation of Q&A Search of Financial reports Using Large Language Models
Project background and Requirement**

We are looking to develop a tool to provide Large Language Model based question-answering, allowing the user to query information from Public Company Annual Reports using natural language.

Once developed, this tool would assist Corporate Finance Consultants in carrying out Industry benchmarking and analysis. By automating the data extraction and preparation stages, the time to value of analysis can be accelerated and further in-depth analysis enabled.

What is involved for the students?

We propose that the student will utilise the Google Collab development infrastructure (12 hours free access per day), and publicly available financial documents.

Data collection of financial reports via publicly available financial reports (10-K and other annual and Quarterly) via a web scraper.
Processing PDF data into a .json or .txt file format (potential tools include PyPDF or AWS Textract).
Vectorisation of documents and build of a vector-database per document
Selection of appropriate Large Language Model and running Q&A Search on the documents
As part of this stage, the student should develop a set of testing questions to assess model performance and accuracy.
These questions should cover a range of complexities (e.g Low Complexity: What is the name of the company in this report? High Complexity: Compare movement in Price / Earnings ratios to industry peers over the last 5 years.)
Nice-to-Have: Develop UI interface allowing Financial Analyst user to load documents, select company(s) for assessment, and query reports.
